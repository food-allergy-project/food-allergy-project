<p>
    <strong>Profession:</strong>
        Sarah works as a full time nurse at a local hospital down the road from where she lives. She recently came across a middle age patient at work who just found out she was allergic to dairy and soy. Sarah thought she might want to get a check on herself, as she didn't know you can get allergies in the middle of your life. She ended up finding out she too is allergic to soy.

    Sarah doesn't have too much free time, she works a ton and is usually exhausted after work and will just eat and get some sleep after a long day at work. Sarah's tired of looking at different recipe websites that have a huge list of recipes that's overwhelming and confusing to read. She's tried of clicking on one recipe she might like only to be redirected to some new website that has nothing to do with what she is looking for.
